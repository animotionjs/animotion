## Animotion

Animotion is a presentational framework for creating beautiful slides and visualizing ideas with code using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Setup

The quickest way to get started with Animotion:

```
npm create @animotion
```

## Windows

If the Animotion CLI doesn't work on Windows try:

```
npx @animotion/create
```

## Docs

To learn how to use Animotion read the [Animotion documentation](https://animotion.pages.dev).

## Examples

You can look at the [examples repository](https://github.com/animotionjs/examples) if you want to understand how I use Animotion to visualize ideas with code. You can try the examples in the browser thanks to [SvelteLab](https://www.sveltelab.dev/).
